## Nicole's EDA looking at humidity and heat index as variables of interest

# Heat Index

```{r pitch speed & heat index}

# examine distribution of heat index
complete_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heat_index)) +
  geom_histogram()
# pretty much normally distributed overall

# distribution by stadium
complete_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heat_index, fill = team_name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .4, adjust = .5)
# we can see that there are some teams that have a broader distribution; places like San Diego the heat index is pretty stable; we can break up by regions in other analyses 

# basic scatterplot of pitch speed (all pitches) vs. heat index
complete_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heat_index, y = start_speed)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3)
# not informative

# separate by region
# create new region variable
# complete_db = 
#   dplyr::mutate(complete_db, region = ifelse(team_name == "Baltimore Orioles" | team_name == "Boston Red Sox" | team_name == "New York Yankees" | team_name == "Tampa Bay Rays", "al_east",
#                          ifelse(team_name == "Atlanta Braves" | team_name == "Miami Marlins" | team_name == "New York Mets" | team_name == "Philadelphia Phillies" | team_name == "Washington Nationals", "nl_east",
#                                 ifelse(team_name == "Chicago White Sox" | team_name == "Cleveland Indians" | team_name == "Detroit Tigers" | team_name == "Kansas City Royals" | team_name == "Minnesota Twins", "al_central",

# really want to get the region variable to work! 


# basic scatterplot of pitch speed vs. heat index, facet by pitch type
complete_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heat_index, y = start_speed)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(~pitch_type)
# too many points... let's use geom_hex
complete_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = heat_index, y = start_speed, color = team_name)) +
  geom_hex() +
  facet_wrap(~pitch_type)
# very ugly and messy
