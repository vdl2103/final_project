## Hierarchical Linear Model

```{r models}
#From Brennan's data_pipeline.Rmd
# Below runs a hierarchical linear model / nested model with pitcher_name set as the grouping factor.
# It takes a few minutes to run.
library(lme4)
# Without the below package, lme4 will not give you p-values.
library(lmerTest)
lme_results <- lmer(start_speed ~ heat_index + (1|pitcher_name), data=complete_db, REML=F)

# Summary of results.
summary(lme_results)
