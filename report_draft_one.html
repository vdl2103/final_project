<h1>REPORT- FIRST DRAFT</h1>
<div id="motivation-and-related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation and Related Work</h2>
<p>Advanced statistical analytics are central to evaluating players, developing teams, and informing in-game decisions throughout professional sports. The growing influence of sport analytics is arguably most evident in Major League Baseball (MLB), where teams that prioritize sabermetrics have won the last three World Series. Baseball is uniquely suited to statistical analysis, as its components – pitching, hitting, and fielding – are discrete events that result in unambiguous decisions, as classified by the official game scorers, and can be attributed to specific players. Baseball also generates a substantial amount of data; the 30 MLB teams play a combined 2,430 games in the regular season, during which over 900,000 pitches are thrown across more than 165,000 at-bats.</p>
<p>Sabermetric analysts sift through this exhaustive amount of data to identify competitive advantages among increasingly similar, dominant players. The arms race between pitchers and hitters has elevated the game, as pitchers are throwing harder and batters are hitting more home runs than at any point in MLB history.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># TABLE FOR PITCH SPEED OVER TIME </code></pre>
<p>In addition to assessing player matchups, analysts aim to identify external factors that could influence players’ performances, especially weather. Over the course of a six-month MLB season, teams expect to play in a range of weather extremes, from 100-degree days in Arlington, Texas to snowy conditions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the early spring. A growing body of sabermetric research has found that game-day weather affects umpiring decisions, pitcher ball control, and distance of hits (and thereby number of homeruns).</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-project-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Project Questions</h2>
<p>Initially, our project aimed to answer the following overarching question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the association between weather and the speed and type of baseball pitches? We hypothesized that the speed and type of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitches may be negatively impacted by extreme weather.</li>
</ul>
<p>To operationalize this, we obtained MLB data and daily weather data for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, focusing on the following weather data: <strong>maximum (max) temperature (ºC), relative humidity, and heat index (ºC).</strong> We then focused in on fastball pitches in particular, hypothesizing that these pitches may be most affected by temperature, humidity, and heat index.</p>
<p>As our research progressed and it became clear that overall trends relating max temperature and pitch speed were not apparent, we began to investigate whether the relationships between pitch speed and weather variables could be modified by team, specifically whether a team <em>typically</em> played in an extreme weather condition. In other words, were teams that played the majority of their games in cooler climates, i.e. the Milwaukee Brewers, more affected by heat when they played in hotter climates, for example at the Texas Rangers stadium? This led to a revised question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revised question here.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of addressing this question, we proposed the following analytic deliverables (AD) in our submitted project proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linear model for the effect of temperature on pitch speed (fastball), adjusted for pitcher and other covariates to be determined. (AD1)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph of variation in proportion of fastball vs off-speed pitches and temperature (AD2)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph of speed of fastballs and maximum temperature (AD3)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph of pitch speed (all pitch types) and relative humidity (AD4)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph of pitch speed (all pitch types) and heat index (AD5)</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="weather-data---overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Weather data - Overview</h3>
<div id="prism-climate-model" class="section level4">
<h4>PRISM climate model</h4>
<p>We obtained our weather data from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) Daily Spatial Climate Dataset (AN81d) developed by the PRISM Climate Group based at Oregon State University. This is a gridded climate model that assimilates station data from networks around the United States and applies interpolation routines to simulate variations with elevation, coastal effects, temperature inversions, and terrain barriers. The model includes 7 bands of output parameters at a 2.5 arc minute grid resolution (<a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/OREGONSTATE_PRISM_AN81d" class="uri">https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/OREGONSTATE_PRISM_AN81d</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="google-earth-engine" class="section level4">
<h4>Google Earth Engine</h4>
<p>Using the code editor in the Google Earth Engine platform (<a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com" class="uri">https://code.earthengine.google.com</a>), we extracted maximum daily temperature (<code>tmax</code>), minimum daily temperature (<code>tmin</code>), and mean daily dew point temperature (<code>tdmean</code>) from April 2015 through October 2018 at each MLB stadium location. We obtained the latitude and longitude coordinates for each ballpark from a Google Fusion Table (<a href="https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=1EXApOoxEgJUFlbMjUodfxBSWlRvgQNpABeddHqiN#rows:id=1" class="uri">https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=1EXApOoxEgJUFlbMjUodfxBSWlRvgQNpABeddHqiN#rows:id=1</a>), which we imported to Earth Engine. We used JavaScript code to create arrays that collect each weather parameter mapped over each ballpark location for each day, reduced to the first observation reflecting the grid at the point of interest, which are then flattened to two dimensional tables.</p>
<p><img src = "gee_screen_capture.PNG" height = "500px" width = "400px" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. The image above is a screenshot of the Earth Engine code editor. The map displays maximum daily temperatures across the United States on July 05, 2018 from the PRISM model.</p>
<p>The JavaScript code for downloading PRISM data is provided at (gee.html). A registered Google account is required to access the code editor.</p>
</div>
<div id="tidy-weather-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Tidy weather data</h4>
<p>Next, we imported the PRISM files for <code>tmax</code>, <code>tmin</code>, and <code>tdmean</code> into R, tidied the data from “wide” format to “long” format, and joined each parameter to a single dataframe by team and date. We created daily heat index values (<code>heat_index</code>) from mean daily air temperature and mean daily dew point temperature using the <code>heat.index</code> function of the <code>weathermetrics</code> package, which applies a heat index equation derived from the US National Weather Service’s online heat index calculator. We also used the <code>dewpoint.to.humidity</code> function to obtain relative humidity (<code>rh</code>).</p>

<h4>Helpful packages</h4>
<p>We gathered PITCHf/x data from using the r package “pitchRx” (<a href="https://pitchrx.cpsievert.me/" class="uri">https://pitchrx.cpsievert.me/</a>). The “pitchRx” package relies on the “XML2R” package to easily convert XML tables into data tables in r. In particular, the “scrape” function in the “pitchRx” package allows you to gather all the pitch data between a specified start and end date. The pitchRx also includes</p>
<p>Gathering a large amount of pitch data, however, may use up too much random-access memory. To solve this problem, we used the “dplyr” package to create an SQLite database, which aids in memory management.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>As outlined in our 11/07/2018 project proposal, based on previous reports and anecdotal evidence, our group hypothesized that weather would impact Major League Baseball players’ pitch speeds. Specifically, we hypothesized that higher temperatures, humidity, and heat index would be negatively associated with pitch speeds. Therefore, our weather variables of interest were: <strong>maximum temperature (ºC), relative humidity (expressed as a percentage), and heat index (ºC).</strong></p>
<p>In order to become familiar with the data, a series of graphs were created to explore potential associations between pitch speed (miles per hour) with our weather variables of interest.</p>
<div id="maximum-temperature" class="section level3">
<h3>Maximum Temperature</h3>
<p>Initially, our team hypothesized that the proportion of pitches that are fastballs on any given day may decrease during warmer temperatures, and so a graph of the proportion of fastballs and maximum temperature was created (AD2, below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create proportion of ff to all pitch dataset

propff_db = pitch_tidy_db %&gt;% 
  mutate(ff = str_detect(pitch_type, &quot;FF&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(y, m, d, tmax) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            ff_sum = sum(ff, na.rm = TRUE),
            prop_ff = (ff_sum/n)*100) %&gt;% 
  mutate(prop_ff = round(prop_ff, digits = 1))

# tmax and proportion of ff  

propff_db %&gt;%
  filter(prop_ff != 0) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_ff, y = tmax)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = &quot;Figure 2: Proportion of Thrown Pitches that are Fastballs and Max Temperature&quot;,
    x = &quot;Proportion of Pitches that are Fastballs&quot;,
    y = &quot;Max Temperature (C)&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="report_draft_one_files/figure-html/prop.%20ff%20and%20tmax-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>However, the graph indicated that absolutely no association existed between these variables.</p>
<p>Next, several graphs were created to explore the associations between the speed of fastballs and maximum temperature (AD3). Graphs that depicted fastball speed and temperature overall did not suggest specific associations (not shown), so the data was instead faceted by various variables to explore the potential for variation by items such as pitch outcome, team, and pitch type. As one example below, fastball pitch speed against max temperature was plotted, and then faceted by pitch outcome (such as Strikeout, Walk, Single, etc).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pitch_tidy_db %&gt;% 
  filter(pitch_type == &quot;FF&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = start_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~event) +
  labs(
    title = &quot;Figure 3: Fastball Pitch Speed and Max Temperature, by Pitch Outcome&quot;,
    x = &quot;Max Temperature (C)&quot;,
    y = &quot;Pitch Starting Speed (MPH)&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="report_draft_one_files/figure-html/ff%20speed%20and%20temp,%20by%20outcome-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, we can see from the increase in points on the right side of facets such as “Double,” “Flyout,” “Lineout,” “Home Run,” and other outcomes that pitch outcome may be affected by temperature. It may be possible that when temperatures are higher, pitches that are slightly slower are more likely to result in hits.</p>
<p>In further exploratory analysis, fastball speed and tempearture was also faceted by home team name (shown below), inning, and fowl/ball/strike status, and a graph of max temperature and pitch speed for all pitches, faceted by pitch type, was created (all not shown). There were some variations by inning and home team, and after discussion, we decided this might in fact be representative of changes in pitcher, and differences in whether or not a pitcher from a specific team typically played in warmer or colder weather. We decided to perform further analysis on this hypothesis; plots are shown in the “Additional Analysis: Plots” section of this report.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pitch_tidy_db %&gt;% 
  filter(pitch_type == &quot;FF&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = start_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~team_name) +
  labs(
    title = &quot;Figure 4: Fastball Pitch Speed and Max Temperature, by Home Team&quot;,
    x = &quot;Max Temperature (C)&quot;,
    y = &quot;Pitch Starting Speed (MPH)&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="report_draft_one_files/figure-html/ff%20speed%20and%20temp,%20by%20home%20team%20name-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Further analysis restricted pitch type to the four-seam fastball, and facetted by top and bottom of the inning, to see if Rangers’ pitchers were less effected by heat than visiting pitchers. Additionally, a team from a colder climate, the Boston Red Sox, was selected for the same analysis. Month was restricted to September for two reasons: (1) during this month temperatures are in greater flux across the United States, and it may be reasonable to assume Texas is much hotter than other parts of the US and Boston is much colder, and (2) it has been suggested anecdotally that baseball pitchers may be affected most by changes in temperature, rather than by absolute heat or cold, particularly if they are not acclimatized to that temperature.</p>
<p>The resulting plot is shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Texas Rangers Stadium in September

<p>In the plot, we can see that in Arlington, Texas, at the Texas Rangers’s Stadium, the Rangers appear to be less effected by variations in temperature, whereas visiting pitchers (the bottom of the inning) have a decrease in fastball speed at high temperatures. However, it should be noted that this trend may be driven by one visiting pitcher with particularly slow pitches in hotter weather. In Boston, it appears that visiting pitchers have decreases in fastball speed at colder temperatures, whereas Red Sox pitchers are more consistent regardless of temperature.</p>

<div id="relative-humidity" class="section level2">
<h2>Relative Humidity</h2>
<p>We also explored the relationship between pitching speeds and <strong>relative humidity.</strong> Relative humidity is a measure of the amount of moisture in the air (expressed as a percentage). Sweat does not evaporate as quickly when the air is moist as it does in a dry climate. Since evaporation of sweat from the skin is one of the ways the human body cools itself on a hot day, high humidity reduces our natural cooling potential and we feel hotter. Low humidity can also be a problem for outdoor workers in hot, desert-like climates. Sweat evaporates very rapidly in low humidity, which can lead to severe dehydration if a person does not drink enough water throughout the day.</p>
<p>Upon examining the distribution of relative humidity across stadiums, we found that it would be more informative to examine the distribution grouped by the US region the stadium falls in, so we created a new variable, <code>US_region</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create new variable for US region

<p>When examining the association between relative humidity and pitch start speed (all pitches and by pitch type), across all US regions, we found no associations. Heat index incorporates temperature and relative humidity, so we next looked at whether that would be more informative.</p>
</div>
<div id="heat-index" class="section level2">
<h2>Heat Index</h2>
<p>We first conducted exploratory analyses looking at the <strong>heat index (ºC).</strong></p>
<p>For people working outdoors in hot weather, both air temperature and humidity affect how hot they feel. The “heat index” is a single value that takes both temperature and humidity into account. The higher the heat index, the hotter the weather feels, since sweat does not readily evaporate and cool the skin. The heat index is a better measure than air temperature alone for estimating the risk to workers from environmental heat sources. Thus, we also assumed that high heat index would negatively affect pitchers’ performance.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The multitude of available MLB data provides a golden opportunity to use statistical analysis to determine how environmental factors, such as weather, impact sports performance at the very apex of human accomplishment. Using data from more than 2.5 million pitches, this project attempted to answer a small portion of this question, by focusing on the impact of temperature, heat index, and relative humidity on starting pitch speed of four-seam fastballs thrown by MLB pitchers in the 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons.</p>
<p>Results suggest that there may be a small but measurable effect of certain weather parameters, including temperature and heat index, on the start speed of four-seam fastball pitches, such that increases in heat index and temperature result in slight increases in pitch speed. This pitch type is the most commonly used in the MLB (currently), and represents the extreme in human athletic accomplishment (105 mph!!!). Anecdotally, pitchers have reported feeling looser and being able to throw faster in warmer weather, supporting the statistical analysis found in this report. Additionally, this analysis suggests that associations between temperature, heat index, and pitch speed may vary by region and location, but more advanced statistical analysis needs to be completed to determine what role (if any) this plays. One hypothesis is that pitchers may become acclimatized to weather, so that they are less impacted by extreme temperatures and heat index if they are used to playing in that type of weather. Thus, it would follow that region and more specifically, homefield location, impact the association between temperature, heat index, and pitch speed.</p>
<p>Regardless of the weather, one thing is certain: MLB pitchers throw four-seam fastballs at remarkable speeds, and do so in a variety of sometimes extreme weather conditions over an extensive season. Analysis of how various weather events impact pitching performance will hopefully assist athletes to push the envelope even further, matching their own abilities with weather conditions to shatter new barriers. Here’s to the next few decades of sports performance, backed by advanced statistical analysis and a better understanding of how weather impacts pitch speed!</p>
