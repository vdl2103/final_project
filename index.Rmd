#### Introduction

Advanced statistical analytics are central to evaluating players, developing teams, and informing in-game decisions throughout professional sports. The growing influence of sport analytics is arguably most evident in Major League Baseball, where teams that prioritize [sabermetrics](https://sabr.org/sabermetrics) have won the last three World Series. Baseball is uniquely suited to statistical analysis, as its components – pitching, hitting, and fielding – are discrete events that result in unambiguous decisions, as classified by the official game scorers, and can be attributed to specific players. Baseball also generates a substantial amount of data; the 30 MLB teams play a combined 2,430 games in the regular season, during which over 900,000 pitches are thrown across more than 165,000 at-bats.
